## Video 1 : Introduction

In this video, we provide an introduction and overview of the topics that will be coverted throughout the series.

[Introduction](https://youtu.be/vISLS8aY0RU)

## Video 2 : What is AI and ML?

In this video, we go over what AI and Machine Learning are, what you can do with AI and ML, and how you as a .NET developer can get started using AI and Machine Learning in your applications.

[What is AI and ML?](https://youtu.be/Len8KRBFvGo)

## Video 3 : Introduction to ChatGPT

In this video, we discuss what ChatGPT is, define ChatGPT chat roles, learn about the role of chat and message history, and get started using ChatGPT in .NET.

[Introduction to ChatGPT](https://youtu.be/138LP5oztVg)

## Video 4 : Prompts & Prompt Engineering

In this video, we learn what prompts and prompt enginnering are, provide an overview of the different parts of a prompt, give tips for improving your prompts, and show these techniques in action.

[Prompts & Prompt Engineering](https://youtu.be/0KuZJsm84-k)


## Video 5 : Adding context to your prompts

In this video, we go over how you can use your data to provide more context to language models like ChatGPT to help augment and provide more relevant responses. We also introduce a pattern known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

[Adding context to your prompts](https://youtu.be/cNtBT2CsVIk)

## Video 6 : Adding context to your prompts

In this video, we introduce what ChatGPT Plugins are and how they can be used to extend the functionality of language models. We then show how you can get started building and testing ChatGPT Plugins using .NET.
